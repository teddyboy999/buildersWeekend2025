# buildersWeekend2025
Public Hackathon GitHub for Builders Weekend 2025

# Technologies Used
1. XpressAI
2. Morph

# Project Summary
CRM, Inventory Management, Stock Unit Management System to predict ideal restock dates based 
on historical item stock trends and the depletion rate of each item. 
Our app determines the ideal day to restock the item before it's close to depletion.

# Project Details
Our project focused on predicting the ideal dates to restock inventory and stock items based on past stock/item inventory data. Within the short time frame we were able to make a base model with an AI backend, secure and private database management system, and a friendly UX, that was both convenient and practical. Overall, here are the main features of our application:
1. AI Backend that trains upon stock data over a long duration/time-period.
2. Secure Database that saves User Data and ensures confidentiality.
3. Simple and easy-to-use frontend that doesn't take long to get used to.
This is project has massive scope for the future and I wish to revisit it sometime soon.
