## About The Project

Inventory management is a critical challenge for businesses of all sizes. Running out of stock leads to lost sales, while overstocking ties up capital. This project, created during a hackathon, addresses this problem by using **AI to predict optimal restocking schedules**.

This application analyzes historical stock data to understand the unique depletion rate of each item. Based on these trends, it forecasts the ideal date to reorder, ensuring inventory levels are maintained efficiently.

The goal is to provide a practical and intelligent tool that helps businesses **minimize stockouts and reduce excess inventory**, leading to better cash flow and customer satisfaction.
